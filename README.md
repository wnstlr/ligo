LIGO
====
Python scripts and results used for Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at LIGO(Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) in Caltech on 2012. 

The project was to develop an model-independent statistical testing tool for the theory of General Relativity, using gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescence, one of the main sources of gravitational wave radiation.
